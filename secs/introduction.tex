\section{Introduction}


Given a CPS platform and application SW, how can we find timing bounds which are extensible i.e. evolution or modification of the system doesn't effect the timing bounds. 

A key assumption in verifying time constraints on  embedded cyber physical systems is the that the given timing model is correct.
The time for each step between nodes of the automata are given upper and lower timing bounds - usually given by the manufacturer of the device.
This expands the trusted base to include the manufacturer.

While manufacturer guarantees can often be taken as safe assumptions, such models are not available in many other situations.
For example, when embedding platform independent software into a particular system, the timing model may change based on this hardware.
Furthermore, as cyber physical system component development becomes more accessible to individuals, there may not be a central manufacturer that can provide a bounded timing model.
