\begin{itemize}
    \item Extensive form is tree based representation of turn based games. Imperfect information in turn based or sequential game means one player cannot determine the choice to be made by the other player because both the choices are equally likely. Ex: there are two  nodes of player 1 from the two branches of player 2 and in the next move player 2 doesn't know which branch player 1 will select. Ex: Prisoners dilemma in extensive form. 

    \item A normal form game can be trivially transformed into an equivalent imperfect-information game.
